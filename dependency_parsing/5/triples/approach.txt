(Contribution||has||Approach)
(Approach||use||activations)
(activations||as||representation)
(representation||in||structured perceptron model)
(structured perceptron model||trained with||beam search and early updates)
(activations||from||all layers)
(all layers||of||neural network)
(Approach||generate||large quantities of high - confidence parse trees)
(large quantities of high - confidence parse trees||by parsing||unlabeled data)
(large quantities of high - confidence parse trees||with||two different parsers)
(large quantities of high - confidence parse trees||known as||tri-training)
(large quantities of high - confidence parse trees||selecting||only the sentences)
(only the sentences||has||two parsers)
(two parsers||produced||same trees)
(Approach||combine||representational power)
(representational power||of||neural networks)
(neural networks||with||superior search)
(superior search||enabled by||structured training and inference)
(Approach||train||neural network)
(neural network||to model||probability)
(probability||of||individual parse actions)
