(Contribution||has||Approach)
(Approach||jointly predict||short and long answers)
(short and long answers||in||single model)
(single model||than using||pipeline approach)
(Approach||split||each document)
(each document||into||multiple training instances)
(multiple training instances||by using||overlapping windows)
(overlapping windows||of||tokens)
(Approach||aggressively downsample||null instances)
(null instances||to create||balanced training set)
(null instances||at||training time)
(Approach||use||" [ CLS ] " token)
(" [ CLS ] " token||at||training time)
(" [ CLS ] " token||rank||spans)
(spans||at||inference time)
(inference time||by||difference)
(difference||between||span score and the " [ CLS ] " score)
(" [ CLS ] " token||to predict||null instances)
(Approach||describe||BERT - based model)
(BERT - based model||for||Natural Questions)
