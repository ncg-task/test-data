(degree||has||gain)
(gain||for||each of two state - of - the - art generative neural parsing models)
(each of two state - of - the - art generative neural parsing models||has||the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar generative parser ( RG ))
(each of two state - of - the - art generative neural parsing models||has||LSTM language modeling generative parser ( LM ))
(Approach||present||beam - based search procedure)
