Face Alignment Across Large Poses : A 3D Solution
abstract
Face alignment , which fits a face model to an image and extracts the semantic meanings of facial pixels , has been an important topic in CV community .
However , most algorithms are designed for faces in small to medium poses ( below 45 ) , lacking the ability to align faces in large poses up to 90 .
The challenges are three - fold :
Firstly , the commonly used landmark - based face model assumes that all the landmarks are visible and is therefore not suitable for profile views .
Secondly , the face appearance varies more dramatically across large poses , ranging from frontal view to profile view .
Thirdly , labelling landmarks in large poses is extremely challenging since the invisible landmarks have to be guessed .
In this paper , we propose a solution to the three problems in an new alignment framework , called 3D Dense Face Alignment ( 3DDFA ) , in which a dense 3 D face model is fitted to the image via convolutional neutral network ( CNN ) .
We also propose a method to synthesize large - scale training samples in profile views to solve the third problem of data labelling .
Experiments on the challenging AFLW database show that our approach achieves significant improvements over state - of - the - art methods .
Introduction
Traditional face alignment aims to locate face fiducial points like " eye corner " , " nose tip " and " chin center " , based on which the face image can be normalized .
It is an essential preprocessing step for many face analysis tasks , e.g. , face recognition , expression recognition and inverse rendering .
The researches in face alignment can be divided into two categories : the analysis - by - synthesis based and regression based .
The former simulates the process of image generation and achieves alignment by minimizing the difference between model appearance and input image .
The latter extracts features around key points and regresses it to the ground truth landmarks .
With the development in the last decade , face alignment across medium poses , where the yaw angle is less than 45 and all the landmarks are visible , has been well addressed .
However , face alignment across large poses ( 90 ) is still a challenging problem without much attention and achievements .
There are three main challenges : .
Fitting results of 3DDFA .
For each pair of the four results , on the left is the rendering of the fitted 3D shape with the mean texture , which is made transparent to demonstrate the fitting accuracy .
On the right is the landmarks overlayed on the 3D face model , in which the blue / red ones indicate visible / invisible landmarks .
The visibility is directly computed from the fitted dense model by .
More results are demonstrated in supplemental material .
Modelling :
Landmark shape model implicitly assumes that each landmark can be robustly detected based on its distinctive visual patterns .
However , when faces deviate from the frontal view , some landmarks become invisible due to self - occlusion .
In medium poses , this problem can be addressed by changing the semantic positions of face contour landmarks to the silhouette , which is termed landmark marching .
However , in large poses where half of face is occluded , some landmarks are inevitably invisible and have no image data .
As a result , the landmark shape model no longer works well .
Fitting : Face alignment across large poses is more challenging than medium poses due to the dramatic appearance variations when close to the profile views .
The cascaded linear regression or traditional nonlinear models are not sophisticated enough to cover such complicated patterns in a unified way .
The view - based framework , which adopts different landmark configurations and fitting models for each view category , may significantly increase computation cost since every view has to be tested .
Data Labelling :
The most serious problem comes from the data .
Manual labelling landmarks on large - pose faces is a very tedious task .
Firstly , no algorithm can provide a good initialization to reduce the workload .
Secondly , the occluded landmarks have to be " guessed " which is impossible for most of people .
As a result , almost all public face alignment databases such as AFW , LFPW , HELEN and IBUG are collected in medium poses .
Existing large - pose databases such as AFLW only contains visible landmarks , which could be ambiguous in invisible landmarks and hard to train a unified face alignment model .
In this paper , we address all the three challenges with the goal of improving the face alignment performance across large poses .
To address the problem of invisible landmarks in large
poses , we propose to fit the 3D dense face model rather than the sparse landmark shape model to the image .
By incorporating 3D information , the appearance variations and self - occlusion caused by 3D transformations can be inherently addressed .
We call this method 3D Dense Face Alignment ( 3DDFA ) .
Some results are shown in .
2 .
To resolve the fitting process in 3 DDFA , we propose a cascaded convolutional neutral network ( CNN ) based regression method .
CNN has been proved of excellent capability to extract useful information from images with large variations in object detection and image classification .
In this work , we adopt CNN to fit the 3D face model with a specifically designed feature , namely Projected Normalized Coordinate Code ( PNCC ) .
Besides , Weighted Parameter Distance Cost ( WPDC ) is proposed as the cost function .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to solve the 3D face alignment with CNN .
3 .
To enable the training of the 3DDFA , we construct a face database containing pairs of 2D face images and 3D face models .
We further propose a face profiling algorithm to synthesize 60 k + training samples across large poses .
The synthesized samples well simulate the face appearances in large poses and boost the performance of both prior and our proposed face alignment algorithms .
The database , face profiling code and 3 DDFA code are released at http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users / xiangyuzhu/.

Generic Face Alignment :
Face alignment in 2D aims at locating a sparse set of fiducial facial landmarks .
A number of achievements have been made including the classic Active Appearance Model ( AAM ) and Constrained Local Model ( CLM ) .
Recently , the regression based method , which maps the discriminative features around landmarks to the desired landmark positions , has been proposed .
By utilizing the feedback characteristic that the the output ( landmark positions ) of the regression has an influence on the input ( features at landmarks ) , the cascaded regression cascades a list of weak regressors to reduce the alignment error progressively and reaches the state of the art .
Besides traditional models , convolutional neutral network ( CNN ) has also been employed in face alignment recently .
Sun et al.
firstly use CNN to regress landmark locations with the raw face image .
Liang et al .
improve the flexibility by estimating the landmark response map .
Zhang et al. further combine face alignment with attribute analysis through multi - task CNN to boost the performance of both tasks .
Although with considerable achievements , most CNN methods only detect a sparse set of landmarks ( 5 points in ) with limited descriptive power of face shape .
Large Pose Face Alignment :
Despite the great attentions on face alignment , literature on large - pose scenario is rather limited .
The most common method is the multiview framework , which uses different landmark configurations for different views .
For example , TSPM and CDM employ DPM - like method to align faces with different shape models , among which the highest possibility is chosen as the final result .
However , since every view has to be tested , the computation cost of multi-view method is always high .
Besides 2D methods , 3 D face alignment , which aims to fit a 3D morphable model ( 3 DMM ) from a 2D image , also has the potential to deal with large poses .
It models the 3D face shape with a linear subspace ( PCA or Tensor ) and achieves fitting by minimizing the difference between image and model appearance .
3 DMM can cover arbitrary poses but suffers from the oneminute - per-image computation cost .
Recently , regression based 3 DMM fitting , which estimates the model parameters by regressing the features at landmark positions , has been proposed to improve the efficiency .
However , since the features at landmarks maybe self - occluded as in 2D methods , the fitting algorithm is no longer poseinvariant and suffers from the three problems in Section 1 .
A relevant but different problem is the 3D face reconstruction , which recovers a 3 D face from given 2D landmarks .
Interestingly , based on that 2D / 3D face alignment results can be mutually transformed , where 3 D to 2D is made by selecting x , y coordinates of landmark vertexes and 2 D to 3D is made by 3 D face reconstruction .
3D
Dense Face Alignment ( 3DDFA )
In this section we introduce the 3D Dense Face Alignment ( 3DDFA ) which fits 3D morphable model with cascaded CNN .
3D
Morphable Model
Blanz et al . propose the 3D morphable model ( 3 DMM ) which describes the 3D face space with PCA :
where S is a 3 D face , S is the mean shape , A id is the principle axes trained on the 3D face scans with neutral expression and ?
id is the shape parameter , A exp is the principle axes trained on the offsets between expression scans and neutral scans and ?
exp is the expression parameter .
In this work , the A id and A exp come from BFM and Face - Warehouse respectively .
The 3 D face is then projected onto the image plane with Weak Perspective Projection :
where V ( p ) is the model construction and projection function , leading to the 2D positions of model vertexes , f is the scale factor , Pr is the orthographic projection matrix 1 0 0 0 1 0 , R is the rotation matrix constructed from rotation angles pitch , yaw , roll and t 2d is the translation vector .
The collection of all the model parameters is p = [ f , pitch , yaw , roll , t 2 d , ? id , ? exp ] T .
Network Structure
The purpose of 3D face alignment is estimating p from a single face image I. Unlike existing CNN methods which apply different networks for different fitting stages , 3 DDFA employ a unified network structure across the cascade .
In general , at iteration k ( k = 0 , 1 , ... , K ) , given an initial parameter pk , we construct a specially designed feature PNCC with pk and train a convolutional neutral network
Net k to predict the parameter update ?p k :
Afterwards , a better medium parameter p k+1 = pk + ? p
k becomes the input of the next network
Net k +1 which has the same structure as Net k .
shows the network structure .
The input is the 100 100 3 color image stacked by PNCC .
The network contains four convolution layers , three pooling layers and two fully connected layers .
The first two convolution layers share weights to extract low - level features .
The last two convolution layers do not share weights to extract location sensitive features , which is further regressed to a 256 - dimensional feature vector .
The output is a 234 - dimensional parameter update including 6 - dimensional pose parameters [ f , pitch , yaw , roll , t 2 dx , t 2 dy ] , 199 - dimensional shape parameters ?
id and 29 - dimensional expression parameters ? exp .
Projected Normalized Coordinate Code
The special structure of the cascaded CNN has three requirements of its input feature :
Firstly , the feedback property requires that the input feature should depend on the CNN output to enable the cascade manner .
Secondly , the convergence property requires that the input feature should reflect the fitting accuracy to make the cascade converge after some iterations .
Finally , the convolvable property requires that the convolution on the input feature should make sense .
Based on the three properties , we design our features as follows :
Firstly , the 3D mean face is normalized to 0 ?
1 in x , y , z axis as Equ .
4 . The unique 3D coordinate of each vertex is called its Normalized Coordinate Code ( NCC ) , see ( a ) .
where the S is the mean shape of 3 DMM in Equ .
1 . Since NCC has three channels as RGB , we also show the mean face with NCC as its texture .
Secondly , with a model parameter p , we adopt the Z - Buffer to render the projected 3 D face colored by NCC as in Equ. 5 , which is called the Projected Normalized Coordinate Code ( PNCC ) , see
where Z- Buffer ( ? , ? ) renders an image from the 3D mesh ?
colored by ? and V 3 d ( p ) is the current 3 D face .
Afterwards ,
Cost Function
The performance of CNN can be greatly impacted by the cost function , which is difficult to design in 3DDFA since each dimension of the CNN output ( model parameter ) has different influence on the 3DDFA result ( fitted 3D face ) .
In this work , we discuss two baselines and propose a novel cost function .
Since the parameter range varies significantly , we conduct z- score normalization before training .
Parameter Distance Cost ( PDC )
Take the first iteration as an example .
The purpose of CNN is predicting the parameter update ?p to move the initial parameter p 0 closer to the ground truth pg .
Intuitively , we can minimize the distance between the ground truth and the current parameter with the Parameter Distance Cost ( PDC ) :
Even though PDC has been used in 3 D face alignment , there is a problem that each dimension in p has different influence on the resultant 3 D face .
For example , with the same deviation , the yaw angle will bring a larger alignment error than a shape PCA coefficient , while PDC optimizes them equally .
Vertex Distance Cost ( VDC )
Since 3DDFA aims to morph the 3 DMM to the ground truth 3 D face , we can optimize ?p by minimizing the vertex distances between the fitted and the ground truth 3 D face :
where V ( ) is the face construction and weak perspective projection as Equ .
2 . This cost is called the Vertex Distance Cost ( VDC ) and the derivative is provided in supplemental material .
Compared with PDC , VDC better models the fitting error by explicitly considering the semantics of each parameter .
However , we observe that VDC exhibits pathological curvature .
The directions of pose parameters always exhibit much higher curvatures than the PCA coefficients .
As a result , optimizing VDC with gradient descend converges very slowly due to the " zig - zagging " problem .
Second - order optimizations are preferred but they are expensive and hard to be implemented on GPU .
Weighted Parameter Distance Cost ( WPDC )
In this work , we propose a simple but effective cost function Weighted Parameter Distance Cost ( WPDC ) .
The basic idea is explicitly modeling the importance of each parameter :
where
Wis the importance matrix whose diagonal is the weight of each parameter , pd ( i ) is the i-deteriorated parameter whose ith component comes from the predicted parameter ( p 0 + ?p ) and the others come from the ground truth parameter pg , V ( p d ( i ) ) ? V ( p g ) models the alignment error brought by miss-predicting the ith model parameter , which is indicative of its importance .
For simplicity , Wis considered as a constant when computing the derivative .
In the training process , CNN firstly concentrate on the parameters with larger V ( p d ( i ) ) ? V ( p g ) such as scale , rotation and translation .
As pd ( i ) is closer top g , the weights of these parameters begin to shrink and CNN will optimize less important parameters but at the same time keep the high - priority parameters sufficiently good .
Compared with VDC , the WPDC remedies the pathological curvature issue and is easier to implement without the derivative of V ( ) .
Face Profiling
All the discriminative models rely on the training data , especially for CNN which has thousands of parameters to train .
Therefore , massive labelled faces across large poses are crucial for 3DDFA .
However , few of released face alignment database contains large - pose samples since labelling standardized landmarks on profile is very challenging .
In this section , we demonstrate that labelled profile faces can be well simulated from existing training samples with the help of 3D information .
Inspired by the recent breakthrough in face frontalization which generates the frontal view of faces , we propose to invert this process to generate the profile view of faces from mediumpose samples , which is called face profiling .
The basic idea is predicting the depth of face image and generating the profile views with 3D rotation .
3D
Image Meshing
The depth estimation of a face image can be conducted on the face region and external region respectively , with different requirements of accuracy .
On the face region , we fit a 3 DMM through the Multi - Features Framework ( MFF ) , see .
With the ground truth landmarks as a solid constraint throughout the fitting process , the MFF can always converge to a very good result .
Few failed samples can be easily adjusted manually .
On the external region , we follow the 3D meshing method proposed by Zhu et al. to mark some anchors beyond the face region and estimate their depth , see .
Afterwards the whole image is tuned into a 3D object through triangulation , see
3D Image Rotation
When the depth information is estimated , the face image can be rotated in 3D space to generate the appearances in larger poses ) .
It can be seen that the external face region is necessary fora realistic profile image .
Different from face frontalization , with larger rotation angles the self - occluded region can only be expanded .
As a result , we avoid the troubling invisible region filling which may produce large artifacts .
In this work , we enlarge the yaw of the depth image at the step of 5 until 90 .
Through face profiling , we not only obtain the face appearances in large poses and but also augment the dataset to a large scale , which means the CNN can be well trained even given a small database .
Implementation Details
Initialization Regeneration
With a huge number of parameters , CNN tends to overfit the training set and the networks at deeper cascade might receive training samples with almost zero errors .
Therefore we can not directly adopt the cascade framework as in 2 D face alignment .
Asthana et al. demonstrates that the initializations at each iteration can be well simulated with statistics .
In this paper , we also regenerate the pk but with a more sophisticated method .
We observe that the fitting error highly depends on the ground truth face posture ( FP ) .
For example , the error of a profile face is mostly caused by a small yaw angle and the error of an open - mouth face is always caused by a close - mouth expression parameter .
As a result , it is reasonable to model the perturbation of a training sample with a set of similar - FP samples .
In this paper , we define the face posture as the ground truth 2 D landmarks without scale and translation : FP = Pr * R g * ( S + A id ? g id + A exp ? g exp ) landmark , ( 9 ) where R g , ? g id , ?
g exp represent the ground truth pose , shape and expression respectively and the subscript landmark means only landmark points are selected .
Before training , we select two folds of samples as the validation set .
For each training sample , we construct a validation subset {v 1 , ... , v m } whose members share similar FP with the training sample .
At iteration k , we regenerate the initial parameter by :
where pk and pg are the initial and ground truth parameter of a training sample , pk viand pg vi come from a validation sample vi which is randomly chosen from the corresponding validation subset .
Note that vi is never used in training .
Landmark Refinement
Dense face alignment method fits all the vertexes of the face model by estimating the model parameters .
If we are only interested in a sparse set of points such as landmarks , the error can be further reduced by relaxing the PCA constraint .
In the 2D face alignment task , after 3DDFA we extract HOG features at landmarks and train a linear regressor to refine the landmark locations .
In fact , 3DDFA can team with any 2 D face alignment methods .
In the experiment , we also report the results refined by SDM .
Experiments
In this section , we evaluate the performance of 3DDFA in three common face alignment tasks in the wild , i.e. , medium - pose face alignment , large - pose face alignment and 3D face alignment .
Due to the space constraint , qualitative alignment results are shown in supplemental material .
Datasets
Evaluations are conducted with three databases , 300W , AFLW and a specifically constructed AFLW2000 - 3D database .
300 W - LP : 300W standardises multiple alignment databases with 68 landmarks , including AFW , LFPW , HELEN , IBUG and XM2 VTS .
With 300 W , we adopt the proposed face profiling to generate 61,225 samples across large poses ( 1,786 from IBUG , 5,207 from AFW , 16,556 from LFPW and 37,676 from HELEN , XM2 VTS is not used ) , which is further expanded to 122,450 samples with flipping .
We call the database as the 300W across Large Poses ( 300W - LP ) AFLW : AFLW contains 21,080 in - the - wild faces with large - pose variations ( yaw from ?90 to 90 ) .
Each image is annotated with up to 21 visible landmarks .
The dataset is very suitable for evaluating face alignment performance across large poses .
AFLW2000-3D :
Evaluating 3 D face alignment in the wild is difficult due to the lack of pairs of 2D image and 3D model in unconstrained environment .
Considering the recent achievements in 3D face reconstruction which can construct a 3 D face from 2D landmarks , we assume that a 3 D model can be accurately fitted if sufficient 2D landmarks are provided .
Therefore 3D evaluation can be degraded to 2D evaluation which also makes it possible to compare 3DDFA with other 2 D face alignment methods .
However , AFLW is not suitable for evaluating this task since only visible landmarks lead to serious ambiguity in 3D shape , as reflected by the fake good alignment phenomenon in .
In this work , we construct a database called AFLW2000 - 3 D for 3 D face alignment evaluation , which contains the ground truth 3 D faces and the corresponding 68 landmarks of the first 2,000 AFLW samples .
Construction details are provided in supplemental material ..
Fake good alignment in AFLW .
For each sample , the first shows the visible 21 landmarks and the second shows all the 68 landmarks .
The Normalized Mean Error ( NME ) reflects their accuracy .
It can be seen that only evaluating visible landmarks can not well reflect the fitting accuracy .
Performance Analysis
Error Reduction in Cascade :
To analyze the error reduction process in cascade and evaluate the effect of initialization regeneration .
We divide 300W - LP into 97,967 samples for training and 24,483 samples for testing , without identity overlapping .
shows the training and testing errors at each iteration , with and without initialization regeneration .
As observed , the testing error is reduced due to initialization regeneration .
In the generic cascade process the training and testing errors converge fast after 2 iterations .
While with initialization regeneration , the training error is updated at the beginning of each iteration and the testing error continues to descend .
During testing , 3 DDFA takes 25.24ms for each iteration , 17.49 ms for PNCC construction on 3.40 GHZ CPU and 7.75 ms for CNN on GTX TITAN Black GPU .
Note that the computing time of PNCC can be greatly reduced if Z - Buffer is conducted on GPU .
Considering both effectiveness and efficiency we choose 3 iterations in 3DDFA .
Performance with Different Costs :
In this experiment , we demonstrate the performance with different costs including PDC , VDC and WPDC .
demonstrates the testing errors at each iteration .
All the networks are trained until convergence .
It is shown that PDC can not well model the fitting error and converges to an unsatisfied result .
VDC is better than PDC , but the pathological curvature problem makes it only concentrate on a small set of parameters , which limits its performance .
WPDC explicitly models the priority of each parameter and adaptively optimizes them with the parameter weights , leading to the best result .
Comparison Experiments
In this paper , we test the performance of 3DDFA on three different tasks , including the large - pose face alignment on AFLW , 3 D face alignment on AFLW2000 - 3D and mediumpose face alignment on 300W .
Large Pose Face Alignment in AFLW Protocol :
In this experiment , we regard 300 W and 300W - LP as the training set respectively and the whole AFLW as the testing set .
The bounding boxes provided by AFLW are used for initialization ( which are not the ground truth ) .
During training , for 2D methods we use the projected 3D landmarks as the ground truth and for 3DDFA we directly regress the 3 DMM parameters .
During testing , we divide the testing set into 3 subsets according to their absolute yaw angles : [ 0 , 30 ] , [ 30 , 60 ] , and [ 60 , 90 ] with 11,596 , 5,457 and 4,027 samples respectively .
The alignment accuracy is evaluated by the Normalized Mean Error ( NME ) , which is the average of visible landmark error normalised by the bounding box size .
Note that the metric only considers visible landmarks and is normalized by the bounding box size instead of the common inter-pupil distance .
Besides , we also report the standard deviation across testing subsets which is a good measure of pose robustness .
Methods : Since little experiment has been conducted on AFLW , we choose some baseline methods with released codes , including CDM , RCPR , ESR and SDM .
Among them ESR and SDM are popular face alignment methods in recent years .
CDM is the first one claimed to perform pose - free face alignment .
RCPR is a occlusion - robust method with the potential to deal with selfocclusion and we train it with landmark visibility labels computed by .
1 demonstrates the comparison results and shows the corresponding CED curves .
Each method is trained on 300 W and 300W - LP respectively to demonstrate the boost from face profiling .
If a trained model is provided in the code , we also demonstrate its performance .
Since CDM only contains testing code , we just report its performance with the provided alignment model .
For 3DDFA which depends on large scales of data , we only report its performance trained on 300W - LP , with the network structure in .
Results :
Firstly , the results indicate that all the methods benefits substantially from face profiling when dealing with large poses .
The improvements in [ 60 , 90 ] are 44.06 % for RCPR , 40.36 % for ESR and 42.10 % for SDM .
This is especially impressive since the alignment models are trained on the synthesized data and tested on real samples .
Thus the fidelity of the face profiling method can be well demonstrated .
Secondly , 3DDFA reaches the state of the art above all the 2D methods especially beyond medium poses .
The minimum standard deviation of 3DDFA also demonstrates its robustness to pose variations .
Finally , the performance of 3DDFA can be further improved with the SDM landmark refinement in Section 5.2 .
3D Face Alignment in AFLW2000-3D
As described in Section 6.1 , 3 D face alignment evaluation can be degraded to all - landmark evaluation considering both visible and invisible ones .
Using AFLW2000-3D as 1 and the CED curves are plot in .
We do not report the performance of provided CDM and RCPR models since they do not detect invisible landmarks .
Compared with the results in AFLW , we can seethe defect of barely evaluating visible landmarks .
For all the methods , despite with ground truth bounding boxes the performance in [ 60 , 90 ] and the standard deviation are obviously reduced when considering all the landmarks .
We think for 3 D face alignment which depends on both visible and invisible landmarks , evaluating all the landmarks are necessary .
Medium Pose Face Alignment
Even though not aimed at advancing face alignment in medium poses , we are also interested in the performance of 3DDFA in this popular task .
The experiments are conducted on 300 W following the common protocol in , where we use the training part of LFPW , HELEN and the whole AFW for training images and 50,521 after augmentation ) , and perform testing on three parts : the test samples from LFPW and HELEN as the common subset , the 135 - image IBUG as the challenging subset , and the union of them as the full set ( 689 images in total ) .
The alignment accuracy are evaluated by standard landmark mean error normalised by the inter-pupil distance ( NME ) .
It can be seen in .
The NME ( % ) of face alignment results on 300W , with the first and the second best results highlighted .
Method
Common Challenging Full TSPM
8 that even as a generic face alignment algorithm , 3 DDFA still demonstrates competitive performance on the common set and state - of - the - art performance on the challenging set .
Conclusions
In this paper , we propose a novel method , 3D Dense Face Alignment ( 3DDFA ) , which well solves the problem of face alignment across large poses .
Different from the traditional landmark detection framework , 3DDFA fits a dense 3D morphable model with cascaded CNN to solve the selfocclusion in modelling and the high nonlinearity in fitting in large poses .
We also propose a face profiling algorithm to synthesize face appearances in profile view , which can provide abundant samples for training .
Experiments show the state - of - the - art performance in AFLW , AFLW2000 - 3 D and 300W .
In future work , we believe that 3 DDFA can be further improved with more complicated network architecture , like larger input size and deeper network .
