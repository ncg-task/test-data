Segmentation Is All You Need
abstract
Region proposal mechanisms are essential for existing deep learning approaches to object detection in images .
Although they can generally achieve a good detection performance under normal circumstances , their recall in a scene with extreme cases is unacceptably low .
This is mainly because bounding box annotations contain much environment noise information , and non-maximum suppression ( NMS ) is required to select target boxes .
Therefore , in this paper , we propose the first anchorfree and NMS - free object detection model , called weakly supervised multimodal annotation segmentation ( WSMA - Seg ) , which utilizes segmentation models to achieve an accurate and robust object detection without NMS .
In WSMA - Seg , multimodal annotations are proposed to achieve an instance - aware segmentation using weakly supervised bounding boxes ; we also develop a run-data - based following algorithm to trace contours of objects .
In addition , we propose a multi-scale pooling segmentation ( MSP - Seg ) as the underlying segmentation model of WSMA - Seg to achieve a more accurate segmentation and to enhance the detection accuracy of WSMA - Seg. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed WSMA - Seg approach outperforms the state - of - the - art detectors .
Introduction
Object detection in images is one of the most widely explored tasks in computer vision .
Existing deep learning approaches to solve this task ( e.g. , R - CNN and its variants ) mainly rely on region proposal mechanisms ( e.g. , region proposal networks ( RPN s ) ) to generate potential bounding boxes in an image and then classify these bounding boxes to achieve object detection .
Although such mechanisms can generally achieve a good detection performance under normal circumstances , their recall in a scene with extreme cases ( e.g. , complex occlusion ( ) , poor illumination ( ) , and large - scale small objects ( ) ) is unacceptably low .
Specifically , detecting objects under extreme cases via region proposal mechanisms encounters two challenges :
First , the performance of region proposal mechanisms highly depends on the purity of bounding boxes ; however , the annotated bounding boxes in extreme cases usually contain much more environment noise than those in normal cases .
This inevitably increases the difficulty of model learning and decreases the resulting confidence scores of bounding boxes , which consequently weakens the detection performance .
Second , non-maximum suppression ( NMS ) operations are used in region proposal mechanisms to select target boxes by setting an intersection over union ( IoU ) threshold to filter other bounding boxes .
However , it is very hard ( and sometimes even impossible ) to find an appropriate threshold to adapt to the very complex situations in extreme cases .
Motivated by this , in this work , we propose a weakly supervised multimodal annotation segmentation ( WSMA - Seg ) approach , which uses segmentation models to achieve an accurate and robust object detection without NMS .
It consists of two phases , namely , a training and a testing phase .
In the training phase , WSMA - Seg first converts weakly supervised bounding box annotations in detection tasks to multi-channel segmentation - like masks , called multimodal annotations ; then , a segmentation model is trained using multimodal annotations as labels to learn multimodal heatmaps for the training images .
In the testing phase , the resulting heatmaps of a given test image are converted into an instance - aware segmentation map based on a pixel - level logic operation ; then , a contour tracing operation is conducted to generate contours for objects using the segmentation map ; finally , bounding boxes of objects are created as circumscribed quadrilaterals of their corresponding contours .
WSMA - Seg has the following advantages : ( i ) as an NMS - free solution , WSMA - Seg avoids all hyperparameters related to anchor boxes and NMS ; so , the above - mentioned threshold selection problem is also avoided ; ( ii ) the complex occlusion problem can be alleviated by utilizing the topological structure of segmentation - like multimodal annotations ; and ( iii ) multimodal annotations are pixel - level annotations ; so , they can describe the objects more accurately and overcome the above - mentioned environment noise problem .
Furthermore , it is obvious that the performance of the proposed WSMA - Seg approach greatly depends on the segmentation performance of the underlying segmentation model .
Therefore , in this work , we further propose a multi-scale pooling segmentation ( MSP - Seg ) model , which is used as the underlying segmentation model of WSMA - Seg to achieve a more accurate segmentation ( especially for extreme cases , e.g. , very small objects ) , and consequently enhances the detection accuracy of WSMA - Seg .
The contributions of this paper are briefly as follows :
We propose a weakly supervised multimodal annotation segmentation ( WSMA - Seg ) approach to achieve an accurate and robust object detection without NMS , which is the first anchor-free and NMS - free object detection approach .
We propose multimodal annotations to achieve an instance - aware segmentation using weakly supervised bounding boxes ; we also develop a run-data - based following algorithm to trace contours of objects .
We propose a multi-scale pooling segmentation ( MSP - Seg ) model to achieve a more accurate segmentation and to enhance the detection accuracy of WSMA - Seg .
We have conducted extensive experimental studies on the Rebar Head , WIDER Face , and MS COCO datasets ; the results show that the proposed WSMA - Seg approach outperforms the state - of - the - art detectors on all testing datasets .
Weakly Supervised Multimodal Annotation Segmentation
In this section , we introduce our approach to object detection using weakly supervised multimodal annotation segmentation ( WSMA - Seg ) .
WSMA - Seg generally consists of two phases : a training phase and a testing phase .
In the training phase , as shown in , WSMA - Seg first converts the weakly supervised bounding box annotations to pixel - level segmentation - like masks with three channels , representing interior , boundary , and boundary on interior masking information , respectively ; the resulting annotations are called multimodal annotations ; then , multimodal annotations are used as labels to train an underlying segmentation model to learn corresponding multimodal heatmaps for the training images .
In the testing phase , as shown in , we first send the given testing image into the well - trained segmentation model to obtain multimodal heatmaps ; then , the resulting three heatmaps are converted into an instance - aware segmentation map based on a pixel - level logic operation ; finally , a contour tracing operation is conducted to generate contours for objects using the segmentation map , and the bounding boxes of objects are created as circumscribed quadrilaterals of their contours .
The rest of this section will introduce the main ingredients of WSMA - Seg .
Generating Multimodal Annotations
Pixel - level segmentation annotations are much more representative than bounding box annotations , so they can resolve some extreme cases that are challenging for bounding box annotations .
However , creating well - designed pixel - level segmentation masks is very time - consuming , which is about 15 times of creating bounding box annotations .
Therefore , in this work , we propose a methodology to automatically convert bounding box annotations to segmentation - like multimodal annotations , which are pixel - level geometric segmentation - like multichannel annotations .
Here , " geometric segmentationlike " means that the multimodal annotations are not strict segmentation annotations ; rather , they are annotations generated from simple geometries , e.g. , inscribed ellipses of bounding boxes .
This is motivated by the finding in that pixel - level segmentation information is not fully utilized by segmentation models ; we thus believe that well - designed pixel - level segmentation annotations may not be essential to achieve a reasonable performance ; rather , pixel - level geometric annotations should be enough .
Furthermore , to generate a bounding box for each object in the image , an instance - aware segmentation is required ; to achieve this , multimodal annotations are designed to have multiple channels to introduce additional information .
Specifically , as shown in , multimodal annotations use three channels to represent pixellevel masking information regarding the interior , the boundary , and the boundary on the interior of geometries .
These three different pixel - level masks are generated as follows :
Given an image with bounding box annotations , we first obtain an inscribed ellipse for each bounding box , then the interior mask ( channel 0 ) is obtained by setting the values of pixels on the edge of or inside the ellipses to 1 , and setting the values of other pixels to 0 .
Then , the boundary mask ( channel 1 ) is obtained by setting the values of pixels on the edge of or within the inner width w of the ellipses to 1 , and setting the rest to 0 .
Similarly , the boundary on the interior mask ( channel 2 ) is generated by setting the values of pixels on the edge of or within the inner width w of the area of the elliptical overlap to 1 .
Multi - Scale Pooling Segmentation
It is obvious that the performance of the proposed WSMA - Seg approach greatly depends on the segmentation performance of the underlying segmentation model .
Therefore , in this work , we further propose a multi-scale pooling segmentation ( MSP - Seg ) model , which is used as the underlying segmentation model of WSMA - Seg to achieve a more accurate segmentation ( especially for extreme cases , e.g. , very small objects ) , and to consequently enhance the detection accuracy of WSMA - Seg .
As shown in , MSP - Seg is an improved segmentation model of Hourglass .
The main improvement of MSP - Seg is to introduce a multi-scale block on the skip connections , performing multi-scale pooling operations to the output feature maps of residual blocks .
Specifically , as shown in , multi-scale pooling utilizes four pooling kernals with sizes 1 1 , 3 3 , 5 5 , and 7 7 to simultaneously conduct average pooling operations on the previous feature maps generated by residual blocks on skip connections .
Then , four feature maps generated by different pooling channels are concatenated to form anew feature map whose number of channels is four times of the previous feature maps .
Here , to ensure that the four feature maps have the same size , the stride is set to 1 , and zero - padding is conducted .
Finally , we apply 1 1 convolution to restore the number of channels , and element - wise addition to merge the feature maps .
As shown in , by using multimodal annotations as labels , MSP - Seg is trained to learn three heatmaps for each image , which are called interior heatmap , boundary heatmap , and boundary on interior heatmap , respectively .
Intuitively , multi-scale pooling is capable of enhancing the segmentation accuracy , because it combines features of different scales to obtain more representative feature maps .
Please note that , as a highly accurate segmentation model , MSP - Seg can be widely applied to various segmentation tasks .
Object Detection Using Segmentation Results and Contour Tracing
After obtaining a well - trained segmentation model , we are now able to conduct object detection .
As shown in , given a test image as the input of the segmentation model , WSMA - Seg first generates three heatmaps , i.e. , interior , boundary , and boundary on interior heatmaps , which are denoted as I , B , and O , respectively .
These three heatmaps are then converted to binary heatmaps , where the values of pixels in interested area are set to 1 , and the rest is set to 0 .
This conversion is conducted following the approach in .
Furthermore , a pixel - level operation , I ? ( B ? O ) , is used to merge three heatmaps into an instance - aware segmentation map .
Finally , a contour tracing operation is conducted to generate contours for objects using the instanceaware segmentation map , and the bounding boxes of objects are created as circumscribed quadrilaterals of their contours .
One conventional way to trace a contour is to use scan - based - following algorithm .
However , in the case of a large image with many objects ( which is common in detection tasks ) , scan - based - following algorithm is very time consuming .
Therefore , motivated by the work in , we propose a modified run - data - based ( RDB ) following algorithm , which greatly reduces the time and memory costs of the contour tracing operation .
Pseudocode of the RDB following algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1 and an example is shown in . 3 .
Differently from the pixel - following algorithm that requires to scan the entire image to find the starting point and tracing contour pixels along the clockwise direction to generate the results recurrently , the RDB following algorithm only needs to save two lines of pixel values and to scan the whole image once , which significantly reduces the memory consumption and increases the speed .
Specifically , RDB following algorithm first initialize two variables ledge and r edge with null value , then scans the binary instance - aware segmentation map row by row from the top - left corner to the bottom - right corner to find contours ( lines 1 - 3 ) .
If a pixel 's value is 1 and it s left pixel 's value is 0 , then this pixel is on the left side of a contour , so it is assigned to ledge ; similarly , if a pixel 's value is 1 and it s right pixel 's value is 0 , then this pixel is on the right side of a contour , so it is assigned tor edge ( lines 4 - 9 ) .
When both ledge and r edge are found , we check if there exists a pair of ledge and r edge on above line whose x - coordinates are the same as or greater / smaller by 1 than the corresponding x - coordinates of ledge and r edge ; if so , we add ledge and r edge to the same contour set as ledge and r edge ; otherwise , we create anew contour set and add ledge and r edge to it ( lines .
if there exists a pair of r edge and ledge in row j ? 1 and 12:

x coord Of ( r edge ) ? 1 and 13 :

Add ledge and r edge to the same contour set as r edge and ledge 15 :
To show the strength of our proposed WSMA - Seg approach in object detection , extensive experimental studies have been conducted on three benchmark datasets , namely , the Rebar Head 3 , WIDER Face 4 , and MS COCO datasets , each of which containing many extreme cases .
The important parameters of WSMA - Seg are as follows :
Stack is the number of the stacked hourglass networks ( see for more details about hourglass ) , Base is a pre-defined basic number , and the number of channels is always an integer multiple of Base , and Depth is the number of down - samplings .
Stem represents three consecutive 3 3 convolution operations with stride = 1 before the first stack .
Rebar Head Detection
We first conduct experiments on the Rebar Head detection dataset , which consists of 250 training images ( including a total of 30942 rebar heads ) and 200 testing images .
The orignal resolution of the whole image is 2000 2666 .
Performing object detection on this dataset is very challenging , because it only contains a few training samples and also encounters very severe occlusion situations ( see ) .
In addition , the target rebar heads are very small : the average area of each box is 7 , 000 pixels , taking up only 0.13 % of the whole image .
The images are also poorly annotated and rich in diverse illuminations .
Two state - of - the - art anchor- based models , Faster R - CNN and Cascade R - CNN , are selected as the baselines .
shows the detection performances of our proposed WSMA - Seg and baselines on this dataset .
As shown in , our proposed method with Stack = 2 , Base = 40 , Depth = 5 has achieved the best performance among all solutions in terms of F1 Score .
In addition , the number of parameters needed for WSMA - Seg is much less than the baselines ( only 1 / 7 of Cascade RCNN and 1 / 4 of Faster RCNN ) , while the number of training epochs for WSMA - Seg is also less than those of the baselines .
Therefore , we can conclude that , compared to the state - of - the - art baselines , WSMA - Seg is much simpler , more effective , and more efficient .
WIDER Face Detection
We further conduct experiments on the WIDER Face detection dataset , which consists of 32 , 203 images and 393 , 703 faces .
Face detections in this dataset are extremely challenging due to a high degree of variability in scale , pose , and occlusion .
WIDER Face results in a much lower detection accuracy compared to other face detection datasets .
WIDER Face has defined three levels of difficulties ( i.e. , Easy , Medium , and Hard ) , based on the detection accuracies of EdgeBox .
Furthermore , the dataset also treats occlusion as an additional attribute and is partitioned into three categories : no occlusion , partial occlusion , and heavy occlusion .
Specifically , a face is categorized as partial occlusion when 1 % to 30 % of the total face area is occluded , and a face with the occluded area over 30 % is categorized as heavy occlusion .
The size of the training set is 12879 , that of the validation set is 3226 , and that of the testing set is 16098 .
Twelve state - of - the - art approaches are selected as baselines , namely , Two - stage CNN , Cascade R - CNN , and LDCF + , multitask Cascade CNN , ScaleFace , MSCNN , HR , Face R - CNN , Face Attention Networks , and PyramidBox .
The experimental results in terms of F1 score are shown in .
The results show that our proposed WSMA - Seg outperforms the state - of - the - art baselines in all three categories , reaching 94.70 , 93.41 , and 87.23 in Easy , Medium , and Hard categories , respectively .
MS COCO Detection
Finally , we conduct experimental studies on the MS COCO detection dataset , which is one of the most popular large - scale detection datasets .
Our results are obtained using the test - dev split ( 20 k images ) with a host of the detection method .
We have constructed the training set with 82081 samples , the validation set with 40137 samples , and the testing set with 20288 samples .
We use the metrics as used in to characterize the performance .
Four types of metrics are defined and described as follows :
Average Precision ( AP ) :
- AP : AP at IoU=.50:.05:.95 ( primary challenge metric ) - AP .50 : AP at IoU=.50 ( PASCAL VOC metric ) - AP at IoU=.75 ( strict metric )
AP Across Scales :
- AP s : AP for small objects : area < 32 2 - AP m : AP for medium objects : 32 2 < area < 96 2 - AP l :
AP for large objects : area > 96 2
Average Recall ( AR ) :
- AR 1 : AR given 1 detection per image - AR 10 : AR given 10 detections per image - AR 100 : AR given 100 detections per image
AR Across Scales :
- AR s :
AR for small objects : area < 32 2 - AR m : AR for medium objects : 32 2 < area < 96 2 - AR l :
AR for large objects : area > 96 2
Seven state - of - the - art solutions are selected as baselines , and the experimental results for four types of metrics are shown in .
The results show that our WSMA - Seg approach outperforms all state - of - the - art baselines in terms of most metrics , including the most challenging metrics , AP , AP s , AR 1 , and AR s .
For the other metrics , the performance of our proposed approach is also close to those of the best baselines .
This proves that the proposed WSMA - Seg approach generally achieves more accurate and robust object detection than the state - of - the - art approaches without NMS .
Conclusion
In this work , we have proposed a novel approach to object detection in images , called weakly supervised multimodal annotation segmentation ( WSMA - Seg ) , which is anchor-free and NMS - free .
We observed that NMS is one of the bottlenecks of existing deep learning approaches to object detection in images .
The need to tune hyperparameters on NMS has seriously hindered the scalability of high - performance detection frameworks .
Therefore , to realize WSMA - Seg , we proposed to use multimodal annotations to achieve an instance - aware segmentation based on weakly supervised bounding boxes , and developed a run-data - based following algorithm to trace contours of objects .
In addition , a multi-scale pooling segmentation ( MSP - Seg ) model was proposed as the underlying segmentation model of WSMA - Seg to achieve a more accurate segmentation and to enhance the detection accuracy of WSMA - Seg. Experimental results on multiple datasets concluded that the proposed WSMA - Seg approach is superior to the state - of - the - art detectors .
