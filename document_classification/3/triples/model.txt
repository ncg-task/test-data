(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||investigate||modifications)
(modifications||aim of reducing||number of parameters , storage size and latency)
(modifications||on||network proposed by Conneau et al.)
(Model||used||Temporal Depthwise Separable Convolution)
(Model||used||Global Average Pooling techniques)
(Model||propose||Squeezed Very Deep Convolutional Neural Networks ( SVDCNN ))
(Squeezed Very Deep Convolutional Neural Networks ( SVDCNN )||requires||significantly fewer parameters)
(significantly fewer parameters||compared to||stateof - the - art CNNs)
